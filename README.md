# MicroFlow
This code defines a lightweight Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) implementation using the NetworkX library, which is focused on generating tasks with a combination of node parameters. The primary use case is to generate task sets for model evaluation, training, and hyperparameter tuning within the workflow.

The code consists of several classes:

TaskIterator: An iterator class to iterate through the tasks.
Node: A node class representing a node in the DAG.
Task: A task class representing a single task with a set of parameters.
GraphOperations: A class inheriting from nx.DiGraph to extend its functionality, providing methods like get_all_paths for finding all simple paths between start and end nodes.
DAG: The main class representing a Directed Acyclic Graph, which inherits from GraphOperations. It contains methods to add nodes with parameters, link nodes, and generate tasks based on the paths and parameter combinations.
The code examples given show how to create various types of DAGs, like forks, chains, and diamonds, by linking nodes with the >> operator. The DAG is then printed, showing the tasks generated based on the node parameters.

This implementation is a simple, lightweight alternative to more complex solutions like Apache Airflow. It is easier to integrate into existing Python projects and has a lower learning curve for users who are already familiar with Python and NetworkX.
